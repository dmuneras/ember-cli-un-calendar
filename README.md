# Ember-cli-un-calendar

# Description

## [WIP]

ember-cli-uncalendar is an addon based on [un-calendar component](https://github.com/unspace/un-calendar). I created a separated addon
because `un-calendar` has this warning `Warning: works only with Ember <= 1.10`. I pretended to fix the uncalendar component itself but
in my case it was better to create a ember cli addon, reuse the logic of uncalendar and fix the problem it has. This is a work in progress,
but as far as I have test it works.
